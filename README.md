I have not maintained this project in years. As such, I recommend that people **look at the [POIUtility fork](https://github.com/wiggick/POIUtility.cfc)** that is being maintained by [Christopher Wigginton](https://intersuite.blogspot.com/). He has the new hotness.

# Kinky Solutions POI ColdFusion Custom Tag

by [Ben Nadel][1]

The POIUtility.cfc is a ColdFusion component that helps you read Microsoft Excel files into ColdFusion 
queries as well as convert ColdFusion queries into multi-sheet Microsoft Excel files.

## Features

* Optional Header Row.
* Basic CSS style definitions for header, row, and alternating row.
* Write single or multiple Excel sheets at one time.
* Read entire workbook into array of sheets or read in single sheet.

## POI ColdFusion Custom Tag Features

* Create Excel documents using ColdFusion custom tags.
* Write Excel file to file server or to a ColdFusion variable (or both).
* CSS control at the global, column, row, and cell levels (with proper cascading).
* Date and Number mask support.

These ColdFusion custom tags allow you to create native Microsoft Excel binary files. They create PRE-2007 compatible files. The following is a list of the currently supported tags and the current attributes.

__NOTE__: All tags in the POI systems require the use of both an OPENING and CLOSING tag. If you leave out a closing tag (or self-closing tag), you will get unexpected results.


## Document

Name: [optional] If provided, will store a copy of the Excel file in a ByteArrayOutputStream that can easily be converted to a byte array and streamed to the browser using CFContent or written to the file system using CFFile.

File: [optional] If provided, will store a copy of the Excel file at the given expanded file path.

Template: [optional] If provided, this will read in and use an existing Excel file as the base for the new file (it does not affect the template, only copies it's data). 

Style: [optional] Sets default CSS styles for all cells in the document.

__Note__: Name and File are optional, but ONE of them is required.


## Classes
